      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Saikumar Konakanchi. I am an undergraduate student at Anurag University in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. I am passionate about automobiles and interested in software. I have skills in Python, C++, C, Fusion360, and CAD. I am currently planning to gain skills in full stack web development. I am a member of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) club and the secretary of the Finite Element Method (FEM) club. My ultimate goal is to get into the Technical University of Munich (TUM).</p>

      <p>Autonomous Car
        I built an autonomous car that can navigate a maze using computer vision and machine learning. The car is equipped with a camera, a Raspberry Pi, and a motor controller. The camera is used to capture images of the maze, and the Raspberry Pi is used to process the images and control the motor controller. The machine learning algorithm is used to identify the walls of the maze and the path to the exit. The car is able to navigate the maze autonomously and reach the exit without any human intervention.
        
        Web Application
        I built a web application that allows users to track their spending habits. The application is built using Python, Django, and React. The application allows users to create a budget, track their spending, and generate reports. The application is designed to help users save money and get a better understanding of their financial situation.
        
        Mobile App
        I built a mobile app that allows users to learn about different programming languages. The app is built using Flutter and Dart. The app provides users with information about different programming languages, such as syntax, keywords, and functions. The app also provides users with practice exercises to help them learn the languages. The app is designed to help users learn about programming languages and improve their coding skills.</p>
